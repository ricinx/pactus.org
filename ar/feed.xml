<p>Pactus Blockchain <a href="https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/releases/tag/v0.17.0">Version 0.17.0</a>
is now available for download.
This release includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that

It also includes a command-line interface (CLI) for advanced users and wallet software
that allows users to interact with the blockchain without the need to sync the entire blockchain.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p><span style="color:red">The Tesnet has been upgraded and all validators must update their nodes.</span></p>

<p>This version will address major networking issues, reduce network usage, and improve overall performance.</p>

<p>A new node type, “<strong>Node Gossips</strong>”, has been introduced to help broadcast and spread messages across the network.
Node Gossips support the network by delivering messages to non-gossiping nodes.
This gossip option is disabled by default but can be enabled in the configuration file.
If you are running Pactus on a stable and reliable server, we recommend enabling this option for your node.
Please note that this option is still experimental and subject to potential changes in future releases.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>In this version, the private IP address won’t be advertised, and by default,
nodes try to find if they have any public IP address.
If so, they will advertise it. Users can also set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public_address</code> in the config file.
This feature specifically helps users who have both public and private IP addresses to always advertise the public addresses.
Users can still use the private network if they enable the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">force_private_network</code> option inside the config file.
Most users don’t need to change their node’s configuration.</p>

<p>Exciting news for the Pactus Community: Testnet-2 is has launched!
The journey through <a href="https://pactus.org/2023/08/01/testnet-1-concluded.html">Testnet-1</a>
brought success and invaluable experiences, with over 500 validators joining the network.
Despite its noteworthy achievements, it also faced challenges that led to a tough decision: to pause the Testnet and
thoroughly address these issues.
After two months of dedicated work and testing, many problems have been resolved, and
we feel confident launching the Testnet again.
Testnet-2 comes with substantial improvements compared to its predecessor by enhancing the core of the Pactus Blockchain.
Notably, the new consensus mechanism and improved overall network performance.</p>

<p>At this point, we want to assure the Pactus community that this version of
<strong>the Testnet will not stop until the mainnet launches</strong>,
and our main focus is on improving its overall performance and launching the Mainnet.</p>

<p>If you’re new to the concept of Testnet, check out our informative post:
<a href="/ar/2023/03/01/what-is-testnet.html">What is the Testnet?</a></p>

<h2 id="key-focus-areas">Key Focus Areas</h2>

<p>Testnet-2 has important tasks ahead.
Firstly, we aim to confirm that the new consensus mechanism is both safe and efficient.
A close eye will be kept on the network’s performance, ensuring it operates as expected.
For Testnet-2, the <a href="/ar/learn/consensus/committee/">committee</a>
size has been expanded to 51 members.
Both the committee’s performance and block production will be closely monitored.
The goal is a blockchain that remains stable and trustworthy,
even with thousands of validators in the network,
ensuring it manages its regular duties seamlessly.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-join">How To Join</h2>

<p>Want to join the Testnet-2? Great! It’s super easy.
Just <a href="/ar/download">download</a> the latest Pactus software and you’re good to go.
no fancy setups or special gear needed.
You can run the software straight from your personal computer or laptop.
Need some test coins? Pop over to our <a href="https://discord.gg/H5vZkNnXCu">Discord</a> channel and share your validator address there.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-for-participation">Benefits for Participation</h2>

<p>By taking part in the Testnet, users can familiarize themselves with the Pactus blockchain and
be well-prepared for the Mainnet launch.
<strong>Testnet participants will also receive higher priority during the Mainnet launch and

<p>In all Blockchain protocols, there is a concept called a consensus mechanism.
This mechanism is used to enable nodes to reach an agreement
on the state of the Blockchain they are
maintaining, in order to have a synchronized and integrated Blockchain.</p>

<p>For now, we have a lot of consensus mechanisms in the Blockchain world.
Pactus Blockchain uses the SSPoS (Solid State Proof of State) which is a new consensus model.</p>

<p>To explain how it works let’s start with explaining one of the first and simplest
consensus mechanisms (or if you already know them, just jump into the last part named SSPoS).</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/2023-09-28-how-sspos-works-in-simple-word/SSPoS.png" alt="Solid State Proof of Stake" /></p>

<h2 id="pow-proof-of-work">PoW (Proof of Work)</h2>

<p>In the proof of work model, each node in the network should solve a complex mathematical
problem that requires lots of computing resources to make a new block.</p>

<p>In this way, it’s highly unlikely that anyone would be able to change
past transactions and change Blockchain states such as balances,
without expending equivalent computational power.</p>

<p>By doing this we ensure the security and integrity of the Blockchain.</p>

<p>The concept was adapted from digital tokens by Hal Finney in 2004
through the idea of “reusable proof of work” using the 160-bit secure hash algorithm 1 (SHA-1).</p>

<p>Bitcoin uses this consensus model.</p>

<h2 id="pos-proof-of-stake">PoS (Proof of Stake)</h2>

<p>On the other hand, PoS or Proof of Stake is another consensus mechanism that instead of miners has validators!</p>

<p>Validators lock a number of their assets in the Blockchain and they can transfer or use it
till it is locked which we call staking.
after each Block is committed one of the validators will be chosen randomly (more amount of stake,
more chance to be chosen) when a validator is chosen
it proposes a block and announces it to other nodes to be validated,
when a supermajority of validators accept the block it’s going to be committed.</p>

<p>In this system, validators have no incentive to behave maliciously or dishonestly.
If they do, they risk losing the stake amount.</p>

<p>More amount of validators in a PoS Blockchain makes it more secure,
decentralized, and trustable, but it also makes the validation and consensus process slower and more difficult.</p>

<p>Ethereum uses this model.</p>

<h2 id="dpos-delegated-proof-of-stake">DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake)</h2>

<p>DPoS or Delegated Proof of Stake, is a variant of the PoS consensus algorithm.
users entrust their stakes to a small group of “delegates”.
These delegates are responsible for validating transactions
and creating blocks. The number of delegates is limited
to ensure accountability and efficiency in the validation process.</p>

<p>Some Blockchains like Cardano and Tron use DPoS.</p>

<p>DPoS tries to solve the issue of PoS which when validators
increase we have an inefficient validation process. but the main issue with DPoS itself is putting a lot
of trust in the hands of a small number of delegates,
which goes against the principle of “don’t trust, verify”.</p>

<h2 id="sspos-solid-state-proof-of-stake">SSPoS (Solid State Proof of Stake)</h2>

<p>BUT, HOW ABOUT SSPoS? HOW ABOUT PACTUS?</p>

<p>In Pactus Blockchain, we have something called Solid State Proof of Stake
and we try to fix the previous model’s issue, let me explain.</p>

<p>Pactus uses a dynamic committee of validators with a fixed size of 21,
but the members of the committee randomly change in each round,
based on stake amount the chance of being chosen is higher. on the other hand,
the number of validators out on the committee is unlimited, allowing anyone
to become a validator by staking coins.</p>

<p>At each block, validators participate in a sortition algorithm by generating a random number
between zero and the total staked coins. If the number is less
than the validator’s stake, they can enter the committee and replace the oldest committee member.</p>

<p>So, in SSPoS models which are a variant of PoS, we can reach a consensus,
without using high computation resources, having an inefficient
validation process by increasing validator numbers,
and also without breaking the principle of “don’t trust, verify”.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="SSPoS" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dev Report pre-testnet2</title><link href="https://pactus.org/2023/09/24/dev-report-pre-testnet-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dev Report pre-testnet2" /><published>2023-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pactus.org/2023/09/24/dev-report-pre-testnet-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pactus.org/2023/09/24/dev-report-pre-testnet-2.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>In our commitment to transparency and innovation, we’re excited to introduce a major step in Pactus’s journey:
the Pactus Improvement Proposals, or PIPs.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/2023-09-04-introduction-to-pips/PIP.png" alt="PIPs image" /></p>

<h2 id="what-are-pips">What are PIPs?</h2>

<p>Pactus Improvement Proposals (PIPs) define standards for the ongoing development and enhancement of the Pactus platform.
Each PIP has a unique number like <a href="https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-2">PIP-2</a>,
<a href="https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-3">PIP-3</a>, and so on.
These proposals provide technical details for suggested modifications or enactments, serving as a guide for development.</p>

<h2 id="the-pip-process">The PIP process</h2>

<p>The PIP process is open, allowing any member of the Pactus community to propose a PIP.
The author should provide a summary, motivation, and a detailed technical explanation.
The Pactus Laboratory team will carefully review each PIP.
Security considerations must be addressed before finalizing a PIP.
Once finalized, it can be added to the code.
This process helps avoid unexpected issues during development and maintain consistency and safety.</p>

<h2 id="the-origins-of-pips">The Origins of PIPs</h2>

<p>The Pactus Improvement Proposals (PIPs) was inspired by the
Ethereum Improvement Proposals (<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs">EIPs</a>) system,
which had its roots in the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips">BIPs</a>) and
Python Enhancement Proposals (<a href="https://github.com/python/peps">PEPs</a>).</p>

<h2 id="new-feature-policy">New Feature Policy</h2>

<p>From now on, all major changes or new features in the Pactus project require a PIP.
Any implementation must reference its specific PIP.
Without approval from Pactus Laboratory team, changes won’t be approved and added to the codebase.</p>

<h3 id="pips-repository">PIPs Repository</h3>

<p>For a complete list of Pactus Improvement Proposals, visit <a href="https://pips.pactus.org/">this link</a>.
The corresponding GitHub repository is accessible <a href="https://github.com/pactus-project/piPs/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="linters">Linters</h3>

<p>one of new changes in pactus project is new linters we added this month.
what is linters?
linters are just a set of rules for the style of source codes, they force developers to write new codes
in correct, clean and safe way.</p>

<p>why we use them?
the reason we are using linters in Pactus and add new ones, is to make the code more safe,
and also make it easy to work on for new contributors because we are focus on being decentralized even in development.</p>

<p>Testnet is a testing environment where developers and users can try out the functionality of a blockchain project,
without putting real assets or data at risk.
It helps to ensure that the final product is reliable and secure for users to use.
If you like to read more about the Testnet you can check out our post on
“<a href="/ar/2023/03/01/what-is-testnet.html">What is Testnet?</a>”.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In May 2023, we <a href="/ar/2023/05/09/testnet-1-launched.html">launched</a> our second Testnet.
The main purpose of this Testnet was to measure block time creation and the responsiveness of the blockchain.
The development team also focused on evaluating the network’s performance.
Additionally, the overall performance of the software and the syncing process were closely examined and assessed.</p>

<p>The <a href="/ar/learn/consensus/committee/">committee</a> for Testnet-1 was set to 21 validators,
and 584 validators <a href="/ar/2023/07/05/testnet-500-validators.html">joined</a> during the Testnet period.
More than 600,000 blocks were created, and more than 1 million transactions were processed during this time.
The size of the blockchain is about 300 megabytes.</p>

<p>About 300,000 coins were staked during this period, it was almost 50% of the total generated coins.
It shows that users, even in Testnet, tend to stake their coins.</p>

<p><img src="https://pactus.org/blog/images/2023-07-25-testnet-1-concluded/staked_coins.png" alt="Staking chart" /></p>

<p>We were able to extract the confirmation time of transactions.
More than 97% of transactions were confirmed in just one block after submission.
This indicates that the transaction pool and broadcasting models are working fine.</p>

<p><img src="https://pactus.org/blog/images/2023-07-25-testnet-1-concluded/transaction_confirmation.png" alt="Transaction confirmation chart" /></p>

<p>Based on logs from one of the validators, the time for creating a block is about 3 seconds in normal cases.
More than 97% of blocks are committed in the first rounds.</p>

<p><img src="https://pactus.org/blog/images/2023-07-25-testnet-1-concluded/consensus_round.png" alt="Consensus round chart" /></p>

<p>During Testnet-1, we released three versions(Version
<a href="https://pactus.org/2023/05/29/release-0-11-0.html">0.11.0</a>,
<a href="https://pactus.org/2023/06/19/release-0-12-0.html">0.12.0</a>,
<a href="https://pactus.org/2023/07/01/release-0-13-0.html">0.13.0</a>), and the upgrade process was smooth.
At this time, the development team decided to stop Testnet-1 and work on improvements that are not backward compatible,
including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improving the consensus protocol</li>
  <li>Reducing the blockchain size</li>
  <li>Optimizing the network usage</li>
</ul>

<p>After stabilizing the changes, we will announce the next Testnet, and hopefully, this will be the pre-launch Testnet.</p>

<h2 id="spacial-thanks-to-the-community">Spacial thanks to the community</h2>

<p>This Testnet was important for us.
It helped us learn what we need to do to make Pactus work even better.
Without the community that supports us and dedicates their time and resources to testing and feedback,
we wouldn’t have been able to progress as we have.</p>

<p>we thank all of them for their valuable contributions.
As promised, <strong>participants in Testnets will be given priority as validators for the MainNet</strong>, and
will receive bounty tokens from the bootstrap accounts to set up their validator.</p>

<p>We are grateful to all those who participated in Testnet-1, and
we encourage them to join our next Testnet to help us improve Pactus.
As a community-based project, we rely on the support of our community members, and we value any help we receive.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="announcement," /><category term="testnet" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[About Testnet]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dev meeting</title><link href="https://pactus.org/2023/07/09/dev-meeting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dev meeting" /><published>2023-07-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pactus.org/2023/07/09/dev-meeting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pactus.org/2023/07/09/dev-meeting.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="meeting-summary">Meeting Summary</h2>

<p>The meeting took place on 09 July 2023, at 2:00 PM UTC via Google Meet,
with team members from different time zones joining to discuss key aspects of the Pactus project.</p>

<h2 id="overview-to-the-network-module">Overview to the Network Module</h2>

<p>The meeting began with an overview of the Network module in Pactus.
This module uses <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> as its underlying network protocol.</p>

<p>The Network module is agnostic about the content of the message and
handles two types of messages: Gossip messages, which are broadcasted,
and Stream messages, which are sent directly to a specific peer.
The team discussed the relay nodes that enable communication for nodes behind NAT.
Upon receiving a message, the module publishes an event.
The two types of events are Gossip events and Steam events.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/2023-07-09-dev-meeting/network_messages.png" alt="Network messages" /></p>

<p>The team discussed the issue of Relay connections resetting, and explored solutions such as
<a href="https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/hole-punching/">hole punching</a> or using UDP and IPv6.</p>

<p>Some users in the Testnet reported high network usage.
The team discussed implementing metrics for LibP2P to monitor network usage effectively.
The discussion related to this issue can be found <a href="https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/discussions/571">here</a>.
Additionally, the team discussed the customization of network resources,
including setting limits for inbound and outbound connections.</p>

<h2 id="overview-to-the-sync-module">Overview to the Sync Module</h2>

<p>Moving on, the Sync module was discussed.
Unlike the Network module, the Sync module has full knowledge about the messages and packets.
The module handles a range of message types, which can be found
<a href="https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/blob/239bb98120053a220c6732989d9a4541ff0c4fc9/sync/bundle/message/message.go#L41C1-L52C2">here</a>.</p>

<p>It was suggested that we need to define metrics for each message type.
There was also a discussion about the need for reducing the messages to optimize the use of network resources.</p>

<p>The team decided to continue discussing these topics in future meetings.
They also plan to work on improving the Network and Sync modules based on these discussions.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="dev-meeting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meeting Summary]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">500 validators joined Testnet</title><link href="https://pactus.org/2023/07/05/testnet-500-validators.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="500 validators joined Testnet" /><published>2023-07-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pactus.org/2023/07/05/testnet-500-validators</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pactus.org/2023/07/05/testnet-500-validators.html"><![CDATA[<p>For a <a href="/ar/learn/consensus/proof-of-stake/">Proof of Stake</a> blockchain, validators are important for
maintaining the network’s integrity and security. They are similar to miners in Proof of Work blockchains like Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Pactus as a real Proof of Stake blockchain, has achieved a significant milestone.
More than 500 validators joined the <a href="/ar/2023/05/09/testnet-1-launched.html">Testnet</a>
in less than 2 months.
This accomplishment proves that Pactus is reliable, resilient, and trustworthy. More importantly, it sets new standards
in the blockchain world. In fact, <strong>the Pactus Testnet is even more decentralized than some well-known blockchains.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://pactus.org/blog/images/2023-07-05-testnet-500-validators/500_validators.png" alt="500 validators of Testnet" /></p>

<p>One key reason why Pactus can accommodate more validators is its powerful
<a href="/ar/learn/consensus/protocol/">consensus mechanism</a>.
The consensus mechanism in Pactus eliminates the need for delegation, making it possible for anyone to become a validator.
Additionally, the user-friendly application ensures that even those new to blockchain can easily contribute to the network.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-next">What is the next</h2>

<p><strong>To remain competitive in the market, Pactus recognizes the importance of prioritizing user space.</strong>
We aim to ensure that running Pactus is affordable and accessible to anyone, regardless of their technical expertise or
available resources.</p>

<p>To achieve this, the Pactus team constantly monitors network, storage, and computational usage, striving to keep them
at minimal levels.
By doing so, we enable more individuals to participate in the Pactus blockchain.</p>

<p>Currently, the Pactus team is working on optimizing and reducing network usage. This effort will lead to reduced costs,
especially for users who are using home internet connections.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we are planning to introduce a pruning mode, allowing users to run the Pactus blockchain with significantly
less storage.
Although we believe the storage size is already small, our goal is to enable users to
retain only the most recent blockchain history.
This approach ensures that the blockchain size remains as compact as possible by disregarding some history of the blockchain.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="validators," /><category term="testnet" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a Proof of Stake blockchain, validators are important for maintaining the network’s integrity and security.

<p>Testnet is a testing environment where developers and users can try out the functionality of a blockchain project,
without putting real assets or data at risk.
It helps to ensure that the final product is reliable and secure for users to use.
If you like to read more about the Testnet you can check out our post on
“<a href="/ar/2023/03/01/what-is-testnet.html">What is Testnet?</a>”.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-testnet-0">Summary of Testnet-0</h2>

<p>In September 2022, we <a href="/ar/2022/09/24/testnet-0-launched.html">launched</a> our first Testnet.
The purpose of this Testnet was to
check the <a href="https://pactus.org/learn/consensus/protocol/">consensus protocol</a>,
test different <a href="https://pactus.org/learn/transaction/format/">transaction</a> types,
and ensure the stability of the blockchain.
We also wanted to test the <a href="https://pactus.org/learn/consensus/sortition/">sortition algorithm</a>
to make sure it works properly.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://pactus.org/learn/consensus/committee/">committee</a>
for the Testnet-0 was set to five validators, and more than 19 validators joined during the Testnet period.
<strong>Over 2 million blocks were created, and more than 3.2 million transactions were processed during this time.
The size of the blockchain is approximately 1 gigabyte.
The maximum number of transactions recorded in a single block was 386</strong>. With a block time of 10 seconds,
we can confirm that Pactus blockchain can support up to 30 transactions per second (TPS),
which is a reasonable number for TPS. Based on real-time statistics available at <a href="https://realtps.net/">realtps</a>,
we can see that Pactus is among the top 10 blockchains in terms of TPS.</p>

<p>At this point, the development team decided to <strong>end the Testnet-0</strong> and move on to the next one,
Testnet-1. We are planning to run the Testnet-1 to prepare for the MainNet launch.
We will provide updates on our progress and share the details of the new Testnet soon.</p>

<p>As promised, <strong>participants in Testnets will be given priority as validators for the MainNet</strong>,
and will receive bounty tokens from the bootstrap accounts to set up their validator.
We are grateful to all those who participated in Testnet-0, and we encourage them to join our next Testnet to
help us improve Pactus.
As a community-based project, we rely on the support of our community members, and we value any help we receive.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="announcement," /><category term="testnet" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Testnet?]]></summary></entry></feed>
